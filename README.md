# FIFA 23 Team Generator
Welcome to FIFA 23 Team Generator! A simple website that generates 2 random teams with the same rating in the video game FIFA 23 to make the kick off mode more fun and exciting for you and your friends!

## Motivation
Currently FIFA 23 and all previous versions of the game only allow the player to generate two random teams within the same league. However it does not allow the player to randomly generate two teams and guarantee that the rating of the teams will be the same. Therefore, I have created this simple website with the feature of generating two teams with the same rating in order to ensure teams are fair when randomly generated.
